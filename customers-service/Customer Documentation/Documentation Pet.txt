All Pet Endpoints can be found in the "PetResources.java" file found in the presentation layer

/// Service Implementation ///

findAll():
    This method is used for front end purposes in order to display the correct pets associated with a specific owner
    To do this the ownerService is called in order to get the associated pet id's

    The find all method doesn't actually get all pets but instead gets all the pets of an owner

findPetByPetId():
    This method is similar to the previous  method in which it will only find a specific pet of a single owner instead of every single pet

updatePet():
    This method is used to update a pet

    BOTH OF THEM ARE THE SAME
    Not sure why there are duplicates

CreatePet():
    The create pet utilises no mappers and directly grabs the value from the pet request model and puts it into a new Pet Object



deletePet():
    This just deletes a pet and removes the association with it's owner
    That's about all there is to it really
    why are you still reading this? I already told you all that it does
