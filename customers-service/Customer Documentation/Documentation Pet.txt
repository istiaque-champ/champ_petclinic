All Pet Endpoints can be found in the "PetResources.java" file found in the presentation layer

/// Service Implementation ///

findAll():
    This method is used for front end purposes in order to display the correct pets associated with a specific owner
    To do this the ownerService is called in order to get the associated pet id's

    The find all method doesn't actually get all pets but instead gets all the pets of an owner

findPetByPetId():
    This method is similar to the previous  method in which it will only find a specific pet of a single owner instead of every single pet

updatePet():
    This method is used to update a pet

    BOTH OF THEM ARE THE SAME
    Not sure why there are duplicates

CreatePet():
    The create pet utilises no mappers and directly grabs the value from the pet request model and puts it into a new Pet Object



deletePet():
    This just deletes a pet and removes the association with it's owner
    That's about all there is to it really
    why are you still reading this? I already told you all that it does

/// Pet Resource ///

    The pet resource class is used as a controller
    Each method utilises the methods from the PetService interface

    The find pet returns a petDetails which can be thought of as a response model.
    The reason why there is another find pet by id is because the findpetbyid method returns a normal pet which is needed to convert
    to a PetDetails.

    Pretty much the findPet uses the findPetById

    The rest of the methods just use their associated service method i.e put mapping uses the put service method



/// DataLayer ///

    The data layer contains two pet related models

    The Pet model and the PetType Model

    The PetType Model is used in the Pet Model to determine the type of pet (bird, cat, hamster)
    To see this you can check out a pets details page to see the pet type

    The pet model also includes the associated owner in a many to one meaning the Owner model


/// Testing ///

Testing data:
    The testing data can be found in the ./src/main/resources/db folder

    If any of the models are ever updated you will need to edit the schema and values to match these new models in order for your test
    to pass
